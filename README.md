# Linear Regression Model: A Step-by-Step Guide in Python

This project involves developing a linear regression model using the Iris dataset to predict the species versicolor based on physical features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The process includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score. The visualisations and evaluation provide insights into the model's effectiveness and the relationships within the dataset. This project demonstrates the essential steps involved in building a predictive model.
